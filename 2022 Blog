- ...notes soon but model is using 'symbolic inputs' as the computation data. this is what deepmind has been talking about  
- terribly important to understand capture, classification, and what tools used to process

-Symbolic behavior in AI - deepmind, santoro,a., lampinen, a., matthewson, k., lillicrap, t., raposo, d.,  
-whip-a-QUIP => exploring use of symbols, constructure, embedded, malleable, meaningful, grading
