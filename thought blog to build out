2022 - AII blogging and infoTECH terror
Symbolic behavior in AI - deepmind, santoro,a., lampinen, a., matthewson, k., lillicrap, t., raposo, d., 
 exploring use of symbols, constructure, embedded, malleable, meaningful, grading
potential of symbols as a pathway towards computer meaning, self derived - computated meaning, 
"Analogously, fluent symbol-use in machines will emerge when situated, learning-based agents are
immersed in scenarios that demand an active participation with meaning-by-convention."
sort of a thought experiment paper on the art of the possible for future computer architecture strategy. likely being developed as,
for instance, all of the worlds pictures of people is being inventory by clearviewAI. there is enough growing survellience issues and the 
level of "nonawareness" by the new generations is astonding. The command control is present and available right on the phone.

How many more netflick shows, like "Worst Roommate Ever." In the 2nd episode, a missing person is found from filtering through his intternet traffic.

The terror: police get your router ID, and the provider of service then dumps the logs of what you have been searching. 
Result, a short glance at a google map that gives the correct area and remember...

the detectives are working on the ALL DAY LONG.

so back to onpoint - the word of pictures and inventory. neural networks are getting the job done on image 
recognition and maybe that can translate into computer language. Or at least object structures that run complex modules in the operating structure your are working in. 

This is not new mind you. it is done now by pulling a database picture and it setting up a basic environment by dragging and dropping an image.

Guard your images as the only thing left is your biometric data and since you talk on Verizon, et al, 
network they already own your voice which is 3rd in line of the body IDS (blood (dna scapings however), fingerprints, and voice cadence). think about it
