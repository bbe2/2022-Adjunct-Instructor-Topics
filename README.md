-- 02-2022-Adjunct-Prof-Comp.-Science -- assisting with expanding skill consciousness through computer science  
-- Thank you to Professor Santerre, Professor Kahn, DavidP, KatieP, and DebraK for all assistance. Best Brian 

-- QUICK note on teaching: i believe in doing the work   
-- as simple as reading the textbook when im not interested, listening when im not interested, and 'typing' when not interested  
-- the digitial revolution is all about typing so if you were not trained properly I highly encourage it...asdf...jkl;
-- i believe in focusing on the frame  
-- in construction framers who dont mess around. framing is relentless work  
-- the best framers focus full time on framing house after house  
-- 'devil is in the detail' as the ole adage goes, and at this stage not looking for finish carpenters  
-- the devil in detail can range from a 3 page paper to a masters thesis to a doctoral dissertation  
-- lets work like framers, hammer out details, and leave nails and trash whereever  
-- cleanup later (think spell checking)  
-- i know framers of every gender so bias of any sort here - only GRIT !  
-- i believe anyone reading this can do the work by embracing grit  


-- Elon Musk on MBA programs (doi 10.1108/JSM-08-2021-528)
--- "...although MBA graduates excel at creating PowerPoint presentations, they fail to understand "how things work"  
---"...the MBA-ization of America is producing graduate bus students who are adept understanding company finanicials  
--                     but lack knowledge on how to improve an organiztion's product or service offering"
