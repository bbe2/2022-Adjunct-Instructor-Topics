-- 02-2022-Adjunct-Prof-Comp.-Science -- Helping youth expand skill and consciousness through computer science  
-- Thank you to Professor Santerre, Professor Kahn, David, Katie, and Debra for help making this materialize. Best Brian 

-- QUICK note on teaching: i believe in doing the work   
-- as simple as reading the textbook when im not interested, listening when im not interested, and 'typing' when not interested  
-- the digitial revolution is all about typing so if you were not trained properly get an app and practice, asdf, jkl;, fvr, dce, sxw, azq  
-- i believe in focusing on the frame 
-- in construction it is alwasy the framers who dont mess around. framing is relentless work and good framers focus on framing  
-- frame one house, then the next  
-- 'devil is in the detail' as the ole adage goes 
-- the devil in detail can range from a 3 page paper to a masters thesis to a doctoral dissertation  
-- lets work like framers, hammer out details, and leave nails and trash whereever  
-- can cleanup later (think spell checking)  
-- i know framers of every gender so bias of any sort here - only GRIT
-- so thanks for thinking about framing and getting gritty  


-- Elon Musk on MBA programs (doi 10.1108/JSM-08-2021-528)
--- "...although MBA graduates excel at creating PowerPoint presentations, they fail to understand "how things work"  
---"...the MBA-ization of America is producing graduate bus students who are adept understanding company finanicials  
--                     but lack knowledge on how to improve an organiztion's product or service offering"
